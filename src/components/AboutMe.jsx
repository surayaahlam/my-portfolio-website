                            and I instantly fell in love. As I explored <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, my passion only grew
                            stronger. Whether it's designing intuitive interfaces or solving complex problems, I enjoy every

                            Problem-solving, debugging, and optimizing code feel like solving a challenging puzzleâ€”frustrating at
                            times, but always rewarding. I love creating <strong>sleek e-commerce sites, engaging portfolios, and full-fledged applications</strong> that make life easier for people.
